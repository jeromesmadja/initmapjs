<a id="ascii-table" class="anchor" href="#ascii-table" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ASCII Table</h3>

<p>Computers were new and exciting machines for the adventurous to program and operate in the early part of this century. As the technology of computers developed compatibility issues arose. The mathematical value for each letter on the keyboard is a good example. </p>

<p>Every time a key is pressed on the keyboard an electrical contact is made inside of the keyboard. Eventually the key pressed corresponds to a unique number that is then translated into the binary equivalent and processed by the computer. Well what happens if everyone is programming in different values for the keys on their keyboards?</p>

<p>As an example, let's give uppercase "A" the value of 65. If you gave a different letter on your keyboard, say "D" for example, the value of 65 we have a compatibility problem. If I was to use your computer the value 65 would actually be "D" instead of "A." As a result it wasn't long before the ASCII table was created to help universalize values for characters on the keyboard. It's a lot like the System International (SI), the metric system, that is used internationally by scientists and most major countries around the world.</p>

<p>Now that the ASCII table is used by programmers and computer producers around the world all the computers can communicate via the ASCII table values. As an example, computers on the Internet can transfer ASCII (Plain Text) files back and forth between different platforms (Mac &amp; IBM) without any errors in translating or interpreting the file! A partial list of ASCII table values is given below. See if you can complete the ASCII table for characters A-Z and a-z, and then compare it with a friend to see if your guesses are correct.</p>
